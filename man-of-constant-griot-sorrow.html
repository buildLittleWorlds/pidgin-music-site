[Verse 1]
I am a man of constant blessing
God's favor all my days
I bid farewell to wiked pipol
And sinnas wey I leave behind
(And sinnas wey he leave behind)

[Chorus]
God go bless di pesin
Wey no follow bad advise
Like tree wey dem plant near wota
E go prosper, never die
(E go prosper, never die)

[Verse 2]
For six long years I've been in God's word
Both for day and nite I find
In dis world I'm bound to study
God's kommand to guide my way
(God's kommand to guide him way)

[Chorus]
God go bless di pesin
Wey no follow bad advise
Like tree wey dem plant near wota
E go prosper, never die
(E go prosper, never die)

[Bridge]
You can find me in God's valley
Where I dey bear fruit each day
I no be like leaf wey breeze blow
I stand strong, I no go sway
(He stand strong, he no go sway)

[Verse 3]
Maybe some think I'm just a stranger
Cuz I no join aproko group
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore
(He'll meet you on God's golden shore)

[Chorus]
God go bless di pesin
Wey no follow bad advise
Like tree wey dem plant near wota
E go prosper, never die
(E go prosper, never die)

[Outro]
True-true, God dey guide en pipol
For evritin wey dem dey do
I am a man of constant blessing
God's favor all my days
(God's favor all his days)

            <h2>Song Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Cultural Fusion</h3>
            <p>The song "Man of Constant Griot Sorrow" is a fascinating blend of traditional African storytelling (griot) with Christian themes and Nigerian Pidgin English. This fusion creates a unique cultural and linguistic landscape that bridges different worlds.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Biblical Allusions</h3>
            <p>The lyrics heavily draw from biblical imagery, particularly Psalm 1. The chorus directly references the imagery of a tree planted by streams of water, which is a metaphor for a righteous person in the Bible. This demonstrates how traditional African storytelling techniques are being used to convey Christian messages.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Language Use</h3>
            <p>The song employs Nigerian Pidgin English, which adds authenticity and relatability for its target audience. The use of phrases like "wiked pipol," "sinnas," and "aproko group" grounds the song in contemporary Nigerian culture while discussing timeless spiritual themes.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Structural Elements</h3>
            <p>The song follows a traditional verse-chorus structure, with the addition of a bridge. The repetition in the chorus and the call-and-response style (with lines being echoed) are reminiscent of both traditional African music and gospel songs.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Thematic Content</h3>
            <p>The song explores themes of spiritual steadfastness, divine blessing, and moral righteousness. It contrasts the speaker's faith journey with the "wiked pipol" and "aproko group," emphasizing the benefits of following a righteous path.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Cultural Commentary</h3>
            <p>References to "aproko group" (gossip groups) and the emphasis on standing strong against bad influences provide social commentary on contemporary Nigerian society, blending spiritual teachings with practical life advice.</p>
