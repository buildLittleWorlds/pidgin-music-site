[Verse 1]
I am a man of constant blessing
God's favor all my days
I bid farewell to wiked pipol
And sinnas wey I leave behind
(And sinnas wey he leave behind)

[Chorus]
God go bless di pesin
Wey no follow bad advise
Like tree wey dem plant near wota
E go prosper, never die
(E go prosper, never die)

[Verse 2]
For six long years I've been in God's word
Both for day and nite I find
In dis world I'm bound to study
God's kommand to guide my way
(God's kommand to guide him way)

[Chorus]
God go bless di pesin
Wey no follow bad advise
Like tree wey dem plant near wota
E go prosper, never die
(E go prosper, never die)

[Bridge]
You can find me in God's valley
Where I dey bear fruit each day
I no be like leaf wey breeze blow
I stand strong, I no go sway
(He stand strong, he no go sway)

[Verse 3]
Maybe some think I'm just a stranger
Cuz I no join aproko group
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore
(He'll meet you on God's golden shore)

[Chorus]
God go bless di pesin
Wey no follow bad advise
Like tree wey dem plant near wota
E go prosper, never die
(E go prosper, never die)

[Outro]
True-true, God dey guide en pipol
For evritin wey dem dey do
I am a man of constant blessing
God's favor all my days
(God's favor all his days)
