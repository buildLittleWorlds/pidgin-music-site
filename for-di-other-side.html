                    [Verse 1]
                    I bi like owl for inside wildaness
                    Bound to ride dat northern railroad
                    My enemies dey wahala mi evriday
                    Perhaps I'll die upon dis train

                    [Chorus]
                    I be man of constant sorrow
                    My bones don almost kom out from skin
                    No friends to help me now
                    I dey die go like grass

                    [Bridge]
                    Na ashes I dey chop as food
                    Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
                    But I'll meet you on God's golden shore
                    Where all my wahala go end
                    
                    [Outro]
                    My life dey pass kwik-kwik like shadow
                    Fare thee well, my Kentucky home
                    Yu don pick and trow mi go down
                    But I go find peace for di other side

    <h2>Song Analysis</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Theme of Displacement</h3>
    <p>The theme of displacement is central to "For Di Other Side," permeating both its lyrics and visual representation. The song's protagonist is portrayed as a wanderer, "bound to ride dat northern railroad," suggesting a forced journey away from familiar surroundings. This displacement is not merely physical but also emotional and spiritual, as evidenced by the line "I be man of constant sorrow." The image of a ghostly figure on a desolate road further reinforces this sense of displacement, presenting a visual metaphor for the speaker's isolation and alienation from their environment.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Cultural and Social Estrangement</h3>
    <p>The displacement theme is further developed through references to estrangement and loss of community. Lines such as "No friends to help me now" and "Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger" highlight the social disconnection that often accompanies physical displacement. The mention of "My Kentucky home" juxtaposed with elements of Nigerian Pidgin English creates a tension between different cultural identities, suggesting a displacement that spans continents and cultures.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Influence of "Man of Constant Sorrow"</h3>
    <p>The song draws clear inspiration from the American folk song "Man of Constant Sorrow," borrowing its central refrain and thematic elements. The original lyrics, "I am a man of constant sorrow, I've seen trouble all of my days," are echoed in the Nigerian Pidgin version, "I be man of constant sorrow." Similarly, the lines about riding the northern railroad and potentially dying on the train are directly adapted from the folk song, maintaining its sense of fatalism and inevitable hardship.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Incorporation of Psalm 102</h3>
    <p>Simultaneously, the song incorporates elements from the Nigerian Pidgin translation of Psalm 102, particularly in its use of language and certain phrases. The line "My enemies dey wahala mi evriday" is taken almost verbatim from this translation, as is "Na ashes I dey chop as food." These borrowings bring a Biblical lamentation quality to the song, infusing it with a sense of deep spiritual anguish and alienation from both God and community.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Fusion Creating New Displacement Narrative</h3>
    <p>The fusion of these two sources creates a unique expression of displacement that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries. By combining the quintessentially American narrative of the wandering blues man with the spiritual lamentations of the Psalms, expressed in Nigerian Pidgin, the song creates a new, hybrid voice. This voice speaks to a form of displacement that is at once deeply rooted in specific cultural experiences and universally relatable, spanning continents, traditions, and spiritual paradigms.</p>
    
    <h3>6. Amplified Loneliness and Alienation</h3>
    <p>This synthesis also amplifies the sense of loneliness and alienation. The protagonist of the song is not just displaced from a physical home or community, but seems to exist in a liminal space between cultures, between the secular and the spiritual, between life and death. The combination of the bluesman's fatalism with the psalmist's plea for divine intervention creates a complex emotional landscape, where the loneliness is both deeply personal and cosmically vast. This fusion ultimately paints a picture of displacement that is more profound and all-encompassing than either source on its own, reflecting a modern experience of dislocation that is both global and intensely individual.</p>
