                    [Verse 1]
                    I bi like owl for inside wildaness
                    Bound to ride dat northern railroad
                    My enemies dey wahala mi evriday
                    Perhaps I'll die upon dis train
                    [Chorus]
                    I be man of constant sorrow
                    My bones don almost kom out from skin
                    No friends to help me now
                    I dey die go like grass
                    [Bridge]
                    Na ashes I dey chop as food
                    Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
                    But I'll meet you on God's golden shore
                    Where all my wahala go end
                    [Outro]
                    My life dey pass kwik-kwik like shadow
                    Fare thee well, my Kentucky home
                    Yu don pick and trow mi go down
                    But I go find peace for di other side

            <h2>Song Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Cultural and Economic Commentary</h3>
            <p>"With Ma Naira Chanson" offers a poignant commentary on economic disparities and cultural identity. The song juxtaposes Nigerian currency (kobo and naira) with Western currency (penny and dollar), highlighting the economic realities faced by many Nigerian families.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Language Blend</h3>
            <p>The lyrics seamlessly blend Nigerian Pidgin English with standard English, creating a unique linguistic landscape that reflects the multicultural nature of modern Nigeria. This blend adds authenticity and relatability to the song's message.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Consumerism and Globalization</h3>
            <p>The repeated reference to Walmart, an American multinational retail corporation, alongside the use of naira, Nigeria's currency, presents an interesting commentary on globalization and its impact on local economies and consumer behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Gender Dynamics</h3>
            <p>The contrast between the father's wallet containing naira and the mother having no dollars could be interpreted as a commentary on gender-based economic disparities within the family structure.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Rhythmic Structure</h3>
            <p>The song's simple, repetitive structure mimics traditional call-and-response patterns found in many African musical traditions, while also incorporating elements of modern pop songwriting.</p>
